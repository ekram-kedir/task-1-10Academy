For a while, I took it to buy but later on I cried a lot alone and returned back the watch to the owner and bring my 3 birr. I gave 6 birr to my mom. She laughed at me. I was confused and asked her why? why she didn't punish me an other way? I cried in front of her. I repented and have never tried to stole from then on. That was really harsh but polite punishment.

      "2. Confused people who aren't sure which way to go.  I assume that these people worry about their future, instead of focussing on one thing only (getting the first job).  I'd love to chat openly with these people to help them make a good first choice.\n",

Those who aim to double-jump the twin gaps of first global-level job and getting a job in a field that they don't have the requisite experience for.

Now, on the point of getting job, it seems like having a software engineering background is required everywhere (either ML, DE or Web3). Having interest is not enough and pratical. Employers are just looking for demonstration of experience. And the matter is that, it's like it's improbable to learn all the requirements in 3-6 months if you did not have at least a minimum of experience.

      "Normally, if you want to send a crypto asset, say Bitcoin, the network would first verify if you have the said amount of Bitcoin in the first place. But for privacy conscious users of blockchain, Zero Knowledge Proof provide a cryptographic proof of ownership without revealing too much information to the network.\n",
      "Though a zero-knowledge proof is a sophisticated method of authenticating a transaction without revealing much details about it, the analogy below breaks down its most basic function.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's say <@U03UUMM7Y8H> is colourblind but doesn't know it. Now <@U03UKGSDGSG> needs to proof to Yasabneh that there's a difference between green and red. She gives Yasabneh two snooker balls, one green and one red but they are otherwise identical.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yasabneh couldn't see the difference and he's pretty skeptical. To verify Hermela's claim that they are indeed different in colour, he device a proof system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yasabneh holds one snooker ball in each hand and put them behind his back. He either switches the balls or just leaves them be.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's an equal chance of switching and not switching. He then brings them out from his back. Hermela now has to guess whether Yasabneh switched the balls or not. She can know with certainty whether Yasabneh switched the balls just by looking at the colours because she's not colourblind.\n",
      "\n",
      "If she had lied, and the balls were of the same colour, then she only has 50% probability of guessing the switches correctly. So, one try wouldn't be enough to get Yasabneh convinced. Yasabneh and Hermela then go ahead to repeat this proof multiple times.\n",
      "\n",
      "With each time Hermela gets it right, the chance it was just plan luck goes away. Yasabneh eventually is convinced that the balls are of different colours.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proof is zero-knowledge because Yasabneh never learns which ball is green and which one is red. He just knows they're different colours.\n",
      "Very helpful when you try to scale features, the thing is you can only scale numerical features. Therefore you need to transform your categorical (object, string) features into numbers. And that is where this link would become very useful. I hope you will use it.\n",

      "Blog written by <https://medium.com/@kevn.wanf?source=post_page-----de2cde8ea599--------------------------------|Kevin Wang> on Mar 6, 2020 described causal inference by taking the following examples. Every year, 1.1 million premature babies die. In other words, 7.3% of all premature babies die _every single year._ Millions of parents have to struggle through the grief, suffering, and pain of losing their child over a process they can’t control. That’s a problem. Let’s say we want to figure out whether comprehensive treatment after the birth of a premature baby will affect its chances for survival. In order to solve this problem, we need to use causal inference.\n",

      "*What’s exactly is a loss function?*\n",
      "\n",
      "At its core, a loss function is incredibly simple: It’s a method of evaluating how well your algorithm models your dataset. If your predictions are totally off, your loss function will output a higher number. If they’re pretty good, it’ll output a lower number. As you change pieces of your algorithm to try and improve your model, your loss function will tell you if you’re getting anywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Loss functions are related to model accuracy, a key component of AI/ML governance.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can design our own (very) basic loss function to further explain how it works. For each prediction that we make, our loss function will simply measure the absolute difference between our prediction and the actual value. In mathematical notation, it might look something like abs(y_predicted – y). Here’s what some situations might look like if we were trying to predict how expensive the rent is in some NYC apartments:\n",

      "If you struggle with procrastination, these 5 tips below can help you make progress and stay on track. Remember, sometimes, being aware of the problem can help you take steps to overcome it.\n",
      "• *Set small goals*: The thought of completing one huge task can seem daunting. Having a list of small and achievable goals can help you tackle each one, in turn, meaning that you make gradual progress towards completion.\n",
      "• *Organize your tasks*: The point above feeds into this one. You can stay motivated to accomplish your main goals by creating a precise schedule with dates (daily, weekly and monthly) for when you will achieve each of your smaller goals.\n",
      "•  *Focus your attention*: Concentrating on some of the simpler activities you need to complete is another method for overcoming procrastination. This is a major confidence booster to achieve set tasks\n",
      "• *Remove distractions*: They can easily derail your progress, whether it’s having your phone next to you on your desk or having the TV on in the background. Ensure you create a comfortable working environment where distractions can't thrive.\n",
      "• *Forgive yourself*: It's easy to punish yourself for putting off tasks. You might tell yourself that you're being ineffective or lazy. In actuality, doing this to yourself doesn't increase productivity; it just makes you feel more agitated and nervous. So learn to forgive yourself always.\n",

      "[There is] an old Zen saying, ‘Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water; after enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.’ The enlightened are distinguished from the rest of us not by the work they do but by the _manner in which they do their work._ No matter how much life wisdom a person acquires, the chores of daily life remain the same. The enlightened, however, do not do their daily work as a mere means to an end: The chopping of the wood is not done for the purpose of building a fire, and the carrying of the water is not done for the purpose of cooking food, because everything is done in the same state of presence, for its own sake, without goals.\n",

      "We are in our 13th month of the year, which has only 5 days. Lucky us.\n",
      "Do you now the reason of people washing their body in the morning in Pagume days?\n",
      "I only know the rain on Pagume 3 is tsebel(Holy water),\n",
      "Fun Fact: Pagume 5 has a relation with next year's Christmas, both will always have the same day, so for example, Saturday, Pagume 5 2014, so Christmas will also be on Saturday December 29 2015.\n",
      "Really, I didn't know that. What about when Pagumes become 6 days\n",
      "Cleansing one's soul from any sins commited the the past 12 months and ensuring a healthy journey throught out the coming year.\n",
      "Yes, You are right <@U03UFV7TUTV>\n",

      "So the funfact that Nati mentioned work in leap year?\n",
      "<@U03UG32J3PC> Yes it works let me tell you the reason\n",
      "<@U03UG32J3PC> if we have a large datasets we can check <@U03UUR571A5> funfact\n",
      "It is referred as to Jesus being born which led to the New Testament(Addis Kidan) from the Old Testament(Bluey Kidan), so every end of a year points to the day Christ will be born. As a truly new year, new oneself, true change.\n",
      "<@U03UFV7TUTV> And every 700 years Pagume will have 7 days. Another fun fact.\n",
      "It's amazing. Wow.... I didn't know that.\n",
      "Amazing\n",
      "BTW I was arguing with people 7 days of Pagume and I didn't have a reference. I will refer you anymore <@U03UUR571A5> :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:\n",
      "The same reason pagume will be 6 is some how the same as why pagume will be 7, just every 700 years.\n",
      "BTW why do we have 365 days per year? Why not 300 or 350\n",
      "Because the earth takes 365 days to orbit around the sun?\n",
      "Yah. The patterns of the season becomes perfect  when it is count in 365 days. Unless we might see a rainy season in christ mas. It would be difficult for the farmers to prepare\n",
      "Yeah, time the earth takes to complete a full revolution around the sun.\n",
      "If we miss counting 1 day a year, After 30 years the rainy season will start around August\n",

      "Happy New Year for #Ethiopians. :heart:\n",
      "Why is the reason Pagume becomes 6 and 7\n",
      "I can not justify that, but according to the international organization for standardisation, monday signifies the beginning of the week.\n",
      "Culturally sunday signifies the start of a new week.\n",
      "we have 7 days per week,and we have 7722 years since the creation of human being.\n",
      "Number of days = days since creation.\n",
      "Number of days divided by 7 will be day of the week.\n",
      "In a single day we have 21 minutes extra, and in one month we have about 10hrs and 30 minutes extra. So every 4 years they add up to be 1 day\n",
      "And by the way in Ethiopian Orthodox Church Pagume 5 is known as እለተ ምሪኣ , እለተ መድሃኒት .\n",
      "We have 6 hours, 9 minutes uncounted every year. So the 6 hours will become a day in 4 years and the 9 minutes will be compounded for the 7th day\n",
      "<@U03UG32J3PC> It is every 600 years my mistake.\n",
      "And its going to be on 2300 E.C. Pagume will be 7.\n",

      "It's said that \"power corrupts\", but actually it's more true that power attracts the corruptible. The sane are usually attracted by other things than power. When they do act, they think of it as service, which has limits. The tyrant, though, seeks mastery, for which he is insatiable, implacable. -David Brin, scientist and science fiction author (b. 6 Oct 1950)\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Growing up, we say, as though we were trees, as though altitude was all that there was to be gained, but so much of the process is growing whole as the fragments are gathered, the patterns found. Human infants are born with craniums made up of four plates that have not yet knit together into a solid dome so that their heads can compress to fit through the birth canal so that the brain within can then expand. The seams of these plates are intricate, like fingers interlaced, like the meander of arctic rivers across the tundra.\n",
      "\n",
      "The skull quadruples in size in the first few years, and if the bones knit together too soon, they restrict the growth of the brain; and if they don't knit at all the brain remains unprotected. Open enough to grow and closed enough to hold together is what life must also be. We collage ourselves into being, finding the pieces of a worldview and people to love and reasons to live and then integrate them into a whole, a life consistent with its beliefs and desires, at least if we're lucky.\"\n",

Take a look at that week's challenge doc. see what we are supposed to deliver (on the deliverables section) and after you understand what we need to complete and by when you then plan out the week. Now I think the most important part about the schedule is following it, you might not complete everything on time, and you might finish some before the allotted time frame ends, But for the unfinished tasks don't waste too much unscheduled time on them, as they will definitely take up the other tasks time. So by planning and following your schedule even if you don't complete everything you might manage to get lots done.\n",

      "4. Then you will create a python file or files containing the streamlit module to do the dashboard. At this point, it all comes to using the streamlit module to make and show your dashboard. You don't have to exactly show each and everything as you did in your notebook. You can make many other kinds of visualization in streamlit.\n",

      "• Slack participation \n",
      "There are standard scores for each of these components. On the leaderboard section of tenx, we have ‘*week score*’ and ‘*previous week* score’ - your week score is the cumulative of all previous weeks including the present week. For example, the *week score*  of the week 5 leaderboard is the cumulative of week1 to week5, not week 5 alone. You can also view this example like the grading system of university CGPA. Consequently, your previous weeks scores will affect all your new scores.\n",

      "I think we all know what A/B testing is by now right?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "so how are going to do this!\n",
      "discuss questions on the documents?\n",
      "yes of course!!\n",
      "based on the stated question on challenge paper, we can list the task performed\n",
      "I propose we all first clean and explore the data and visualize it if possible\n",
      "then work on the classical and sequential A/B testing\n",
      "sure, it will the first task we should done...\n",
      "here, i tried to list the task performed according to the challenge paper....\n",
      "1. as <@U03UG4Q7V42>, said EDA on the given data\n",
      "2. classical AB testing\n",
      "3. Sequential AB testing\n",
      "4. develop ML Model using Logistic regression\n",
      "5. ML Model using Decision Trees Algo.\n",
      "6. Exploratory data analysis /pipline/ to a new dataset which is campaign datasets\n",
      "we can improvised the above stated task... based on ur given comment\n",
      "Thats great Yonas. We should finish the basic EDA by tomorrow. I think doing the EDA while also reading the references provided will help us answer the first task.\n",
      "i think it would also be good if we are able to finish the EDA before tomorrows standup\n",
      "yes, of course! so how can we do EDA on the organization github?\n",
      "Yeah, that would be great! However, we can try, though I might join you late as I am two hours behind your time zone\n",
      "you can just clone the repo <@U03UD4FEDHB> and when you push, you can create a pull request to the main\n",
      "First fork the repository and work locally then request a pr and <@U03U1HAG9TR> will review and accept the request\n",
      "if we done on a single file/coding, there might be a lot of conflict.\n",
      "<@U03U9FWPNCE> I think they want us to fork the group repo and work on the fork\n",
      "to solve this we should pull and commit quickly. this action might be consumed our time\n",
      "I am not sure that will help us working together as a group <@U03UG4Q7V42> :thinking_face:\n",
      "the fork can help us submit individually\n",
      "read this.\n",
      "Group Work:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "◦ Trainees are advised to submit a forked repository of the group work for\n",

      "\n",
      "evaluation instead of that of the group. This will ensure a consistent user data\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "for the trainee\n",
      "<@U03U9FWPNCE>, if we submit individually, there will be 4 work on similar task.\n",
      "<@U03U9FWPNCE> then we would have so many merge conflicts\n",
      "eg, if we want implement EDA, the organization repo will have 4 file EDA notebook\n",
      "well, we can consult others, I might be wrong for sure. but what I think I heard is that we can fork for the submission but work together on an organization or one of us creates a repo and add others as collaborators.\n",
      "yes yonas thats why we need to fork it and work offline. We will ask this question tomorrow on stand up or ask on all week 2\n",
      "so what you are suggesting is to fork and work individually?\n",
      "<@U03U9FWPNCE> that will work too. we can on branches and merge pull request\n",
      "What do you prefer <@U03UG4Q7V42>?\n",
      "I preferred working on branches\n",
      "<@U03UG4Q7V42>, so for every task we should participate working on branches?\n",
      "branches on share repo? or our own forked repo <@U03UG4Q7V42>\n",
      "that is what i suggest but it would be nice to know how other groups are working around this issue\n",
      "<@U03U9FWPNCE> which one do you think we should you? i think working on shared branches makes sense\n",
      "what can if we able to divided the task, then push to share repo?\n",
      "My thought was to work on the same repo and create another branch to work on (depending on each task) and then make a pull request once we are ready\n",
      "but it doesn't seem clear for all of us now, but I am okay with your approach as long as we are progressing\n",
      "<@U03U9FWPNCE> that was my plan too. it is also same as forking it and contributing to the main repo.\n",
      "let say as example, if there 8 tasks needs to be performed, two tasks per member would be done and push/contribute to shared repo\n",
      "<@U03UD4FEDHB> so working on branches or forks?\n",
      "what about a common scripts and files, for reusability and implementation of SE practices?\n",
      "it is the same steps we took when we were working on the 2 previous tasks. we have a main then we create a branch to work on a task then PR to merge. but this time janerose will review and accept or reject it\n",
      "yeah the scripts are a worry\n",
      "it would been great if Janerose was present as we can only fork the repo\n",
      "guys, we have two options. either work on similar task and resolve conflict if any, or divide tasks and contribute to shared repo!\n",
      "yeah we will decide that tomorrow.\n",
      "but in the mean time lets try to work on the EDA\n",
      "is <@U03U1HAG9TR> has created organization repo?\n",
      "yes it is\n",
      "can u share me the repo link? and let us do on the EDA to minimize tomorrow's task\n",
      "she didn't send an invite through an email?\n",
      "okay, thanks i didn't see it before. So shall stop the meeting now, Mr deputy leader?\n",
      "I think on ze repo name, group 12, is not necessary. is that possible make correction?\n",
      "the organization name has the \"group 12 name\" the repo name is Ad-campaign-performance\n",
      "that's okay!\n",
      "<@U03U1HAG9TR> when you see this you should give us permission to the main repo and we should work on it by creating branches. it would be hard to work on  the latest repo status if we are forking and we would be forking the repo multiple times.\n",
      "she created the repo but we don't have rights to work on it.\n",
      "<https://github.com/Group-12-A-B-Hypothesis-Testing/Ad-campaign-performance.git>\n",

      "If we have a way to sum the result set we can do having.\n",
      "I second you. We use having clause if you need grouping and they dint specify if we will group anything. Or I didnt understand it well.\n",

      "That would definitely be something to look at <@U03UUR571A5>. We can try to use a sub query to sum up the results.\n",

      "'having' clause with district doesn't work because we are checking sum of populations of the districts not cities, which means if we have 2 cities having population greater than 100000 with the same district, if we group the sum(population) will treat them as 1, not 2.\n",

      "I have been absent this week. I hope I will be able to catch up everything. :face_with_rolling_eyes:\n",
      "this worked. thanks!\n",
      "Hi <@U03UKL27B0R>,\n",
      "Could you please provide the codes used during the tutorial?\n",
      "Thanks in advance.\n",
      "I didn't see any suggestion as to how we can defend against prompt injection as we can in sql injection\n",
      "You're welcome.\n",
      "I am struggling. I need help. The previous weeks have been very challenging for me. Sometimes, I don't even know how two steps connects. For example, I don't know which stage database population comes in and why it's needed. When I have multiple disconnections like this I feel overwhelmed and it affects my work for that week. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've realized that I work best when I have step by step guide of what needs to be done. I know that our tasks are not provided in that format but going forward it's the first thing I want to do on Mondays and I need you guys to help me with it.\n",
      "So, for week 4. This is as far as my understanding goes on the challenge. \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Read up extensively on LLP\n",
      "2.   Set up dvc and cml\n",
      "3.   jupyter notebooks: EDA on the datasets\n",
      "4.   Python: Prompts engineering using API (still not sure how to fine tune with this yet)\n",
      "5.  fastapi or flask API endpoint (I don't know how to go about this or even if it's step 5)\n",
      "So guys, help me out here, if there's anything out of order or you have something to chip in on step 4 or 5, please reply.\n",
      "Same here, we all feel overwhelmed, I personally started to think of this feeling as fun, and something to look for, something that I get to do instead of something I have to do. And this attitude changed everything for me.\n",
      "I think you are right....\n",
      "1. Read and research on prompt engineering and its algorithms\n",
      "    a. understand transformer algorithm\n",
      "    b. understand basics of GPT\n",
      "2. Then, I believe the next step after setting up your repo is EDA on the given datasets and customizing the data to get better performances(results) from the co:here api.\n",
      "    a. you will be working on creating the best input data out of the given dataset\n",
      "    b. you consume the co:here API (simply send you prepared data to the api and you receive predictions from the model)\n",
      "    c. Finally you put all these steps together by creating your own API\n",
      "    d. your API should have two end-point ( i think they behave more or less the same): one endpoint for the news scoring and the other endpoint for extracting entities from job description\n",
      "        i. So here is what you will do: your api should accept dataset(in json format possibly) then you transform, clean, feature engineer, the received data through your pipeline then send the prepared data to the co:here API, (notice there are two APIs involving in this project)....then you present the results via UI\n",
      "Your API accept data-&gt;you transform data through pipeline-&gt;send prepared data to co:here-&gt; receive predictions -&gt; return the results to the user via UI\n",
      "That is wha I understood from the guidelines....(please, remind me if I miss anything)\n",
      "Also, the best thing I think you can add to this is the schedule and planning part. If you have for example 20 tasks to do it will be very beneficial for you to plan what to do and when to do it. That way you will reduce overthinking and overcommitting on a single specific task. Instead, you will try to do all the tasks, instead of overcommitting on a single topic or task that might be a blocker for you. I do not practice what I just preached, but I am trying to do that in order to have the max out of myself and my time. Hope that makes sense.\n",

      "I think it would be nice if you get API key from co:here or bloom and just do some basic requests on maybe prompt based text extraction and receive some output from the APIs\n",
      "Yes, you need to setup your env to with different endpoints as it has been specified in the challenge document. It would be a plus if you can connect with one of the available api and get data from the LLM model. Please have a look at the rubrics section of the challenge document.\n",

      "I just wanted to ask how last week's challenge was for you, and if you had any suggestions to improve our performance for this week's challenge?\n",
      "<@U03UUR571A5> It was a very good and precise demo. Good Job\n",
      "<@U03UUP56MDF> yeah, we should do the planning today and start working from there. I think the question of who is working on what task had been the major confusion overall.\n",
      "YES that was our major weakness. And I suggest we start working today too, we have to use every minute we have.\n",
      "That is good <@U03UUR571A5> and I think we all have to get the same understanding on the tasks given. So each of us can have the idea on how we implement those ideas and of course we will have clear understanding on the task(s) each of us are working on.\n",
      "<!here> so til tomorrow morning lets have a clear understanding of the challenge and lets have a meeting 1 hour before stand-up, lets share our understanding there and I suggest everybody should come up with the tasks they want to work on, and we will talk about that on tomorrow's meeting too.\n",
      "yes, that's a good idea.\n",
      "tomorrow morning is good. In addition to that I have a suggestion if we have one additional meeting today evening  to share what we have so far and specify the tasks. so for tomorrow's meeting we all have clear decision on the task we want to work on.\n",
      "We can do that, but everybody has to be there.\n",
      "yeah all of us should be there and today's meeting doesn't need to be that long.\n",
      "Yea 30 minutes max.\n",
      "what time should we meet then?\n",
      "After the tutorial session.\n",

      "*Proposed solution:*\n",
      "• We used a creative way that maixmize the quality of results while minimizing the cost, \n",
      "• We used template matching method wich is available in OpenCv library.\n",
      "• We gave the model a picture of the logo and aske it to locae it’s position on the image.\n",
      "• We extracted the Starting coordination  points of the logo in the image plus the hight and the width of it.\n",
      "• The result was more than 60% of the logo positions was detected ,and more than 80% of engagement buttons was detecte also.\n",
      "*Future recommendations* \n",
      "• Train our own model to get accurate results\n",

      "A time in my primary school when I stole 3 Ethiopian Birr from my mom and bought a hand watch.  The memory I still use as a guideline was the way my mom punished me. She gave me extra 3 Birr and ordered me to buy an other hand watch of the same type. For a while, I took it to buy but later on I cried a lot alone and returned back the watch to the owner and bring my 3 birr. I gave 6 birr to my mom. She laughed at me. I was confused and asked her why? why she didn't punish me an other way? I cried in front of her. I repented and have never tried to stole from then on. That was really harsh but polite punishment. I take as a life principle of politely punishing someone for the misbehave. replies\n",

      "• The challeng was all the available solutions work as API and we can’t risk our sensitive data to be sent to third parties, also the available models need to be trained on large amount of data to solve the issue besided it will cost time and money to do that. \n",
      "*Proposed solution:*\n",
      "• We used a creative way that maixmize the quality of results while minimizing the cost, \n",
      "• We used template matching method wich is available in OpenCv library.\n",
      "• We gave the model a picture of the logo and aske it to locae it’s position on the image.\n",
      "• We extracted the Starting coordination  points of the logo in the image plus the hight and the width of it.\n",
